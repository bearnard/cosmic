# This script demonstrates a basic Python implementation for finding connections
# between mathematical and physical formulae, inspired by the concepts of
# neuro-symbolic AI for scientific discovery. We use the SymPy library,
# a powerful tool for symbolic mathematics in Python.
#

# --- Part 1: Setup and Knowledge Representation ---
# We begin by importing the necessary components from SymPy and defining the
# symbolic variables and functions we'll need. This is analogous to creating
# the "Knowledge Graph" or "Representational Foundation" where each symbol
# is a node representing a concept.

import sympy as sp
import itertools

# Define common mathematical and physical symbols
x, t = sp.symbols('x t') # Independent variables (e.g., position, time)
m, k, c, G, hbar = sp.symbols('m k c G hbar', positive=True) # Physical constants (mass, spring constant, etc.)
v, a, F, W, K = sp.symbols('v a F W K') # Physical quantities (velocity, acceleration, force, work, kinetic energy)
psi = sp.Function('psi')(x, t) # A wave function, psi(x, t)
i = sp.I # The imaginary unit

print("--- Part 1: Symbolic Knowledge Base Initialized ---")
print(f"Created symbols for variables like: {x}, {t}")
print(f"Created symbols for constants like: {m}, {k}, {c}")
print(f"Created a symbolic function like: {psi}\n")


# --- Part 2: Discovering a Mathematical Connection ---
# Goal: Show that Euler's formula implies the definition of cos(x).
# This is a form of "Automated Theorem Proving" where we verify a known
# identity through symbolic manipulation.

print("--- Part 2: Verifying a Mathematical Connection (Euler's Formula) ---")

# 1. Define Euler's Formula as our primary axiom
eulers_formula = sp.Eq(sp.exp(i * x), sp.cos(x) + i * sp.sin(x))
print(f"Axiom 1 (Euler's Formula): {eulers_formula}")

# 2. Create a second axiom by substituting -x for x
eulers_formula_neg = sp.Eq(sp.exp(i * -x), sp.cos(-x) + i * sp.sin(-x))
# SymPy knows that cos(-x) = cos(x) and sin(-x) = -sin(x)
print(f"Axiom 2 (Euler's Formula for -x): {eulers_formula_neg.simplify()}")

# 3. Combine the axioms to isolate cos(x)
# We add the right-hand sides of both equations
rhs_sum = eulers_formula.rhs + eulers_formula_neg.rhs
print(f"\nSum of right-hand sides: {rhs_sum.simplify()}")

# The left-hand sides are also added
lhs_sum = eulers_formula.lhs + eulers_formula_neg.lhs
print(f"Sum of left-hand sides: {lhs_sum}")

# 4. Solve for cos(x)
# From the simplified sum, we know lhs_sum = 2*cos(x)
# Therefore, cos(x) = lhs_sum / 2
cosine_definition = sp.solve(sp.Eq(lhs_sum, rhs_sum.simplify()), sp.cos(x))

print(f"\nDerived connection: cos(x) = {cosine_definition[0]}")
print("This demonstrates how one mathematical identity can be logically derived from another.\n")


# --- Part 3: Discovering a Physics Connection ---
# Goal: Derive the formula for Kinetic Energy from the Work-Energy Theorem.
# This mimics the process of finding a derivational path between two concepts
# in the Physics Knowledge Graph.

print("--- Part 3: Deriving a Physics Connection (Work-Energy Theorem) ---")

# 1. Define our axioms (fundamental principles)
# Axiom 1: Newton's Second Law
f_equals_ma = sp.Eq(F, m * a)

# Axiom 2: Definition of acceleration
accel_def = sp.Eq(a, sp.diff(v, t))

# Axiom 3: Definition of velocity
vel_def = sp.Eq(v, sp.diff(x, t))
print(f"Axiom 3 (Definition of Velocity): {vel_def}")

# Axiom 4: The Work-Energy Theorem states Work is the integral of Force over distance
work_def = sp.Eq(W, sp.Integral(F, x))
print(f"Axiom 4 (Work-Energy Theorem): {work_def}\n")

# 2. Start the derivation by substituting F in the work integral
# Substitute F=m*a into the work definition
work_step1 = work_def.subs(F, f_equals_ma.rhs)
print(f"Step 1 (Substituting F): W = {work_step1.rhs}")

# 3. Change the variable of integration from x to v
# We know a = dv/dt. By the chain rule, a = (dv/dx) * (dx/dt) = v * (dv/dx)
# So, a*dx = v*dv. We can substitute this into the integral.
# Let's express 'a' in terms of v and x first.
a_chain_rule = v * sp.diff(v, x)
work_step2 = work_step1.subs(a, a_chain_rule)
print(f"Step 2 (Using Chain Rule a=v*dv/dx): W = {work_step2.rhs}")

# 4. Perform the integration
# The integral of m*v with respect to v is (1/2)*m*v^2
work_integral_solved = work_step2.rhs.doit()
print(f"Step 3 (Performing the integral): W = {work_integral_solved}")

# 5. State the connection
# The work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy.
# So, we have found the formula for kinetic energy.
kinetic_energy_formula = sp.Eq(K, work_integral_solved)

# --- Part 4: Identifying a Structural Analogy ---
# Goal: Show that a Mass-Spring system and an LC Electrical Circuit
# are described by the same fundamental differential equation. This is
# analogous to a GNN finding that two different concepts have a similar
# "embedding" because their underlying graph structures are identical.

print("--- Part 4: Identifying a Structural Analogy (Oscillators) ---")

accel_x = sp.diff(x_t, t, 2) # Second derivative of position is acceleration

mass_spring_eq = sp.Eq(m * accel_x + k * x_t, 0)
print(f"Mechanical System (Mass-Spring): {mass_spring_eq}")

# 2. Define the components for the LC Circuit system
# Kirchhoff's Loop Rule: V_L + V_C = 0
# Inductor Voltage: V_L = L * dI/dt = L * d^2q/dt^2
# Capacitor Voltage: V_C = q/C
L, C_const = sp.symbols('L C', positive=True) # Inductance and Capacitance
q_t = sp.Function('q')(t) # Charge q is a function of time
current_i = sp.diff(q_t, t) # Current is the derivative of charge
dI_dt = sp.diff(current_i, t, 1) # dI/dt is the second derivative of charge

# Equation of motion: L * d^2q/dt^2 + (1/C)*q = 0
lc_circuit_eq = sp.Eq(L * dI_dt + (1/C_const) * q_t, 0)
print(f"Electrical System (LC Circuit):   {lc_circuit_eq}")

# 3. Compare the structures
# We can see that both equations are of the form:
# (Constant1) * (Second Derivative of a Function) + (Constant2) * (The Function) = 0
# This identical mathematical form implies that the two systems are analogous.
# They will both exhibit simple harmonic motion.
